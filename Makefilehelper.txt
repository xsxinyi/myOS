ld 
		-N
       --omagic
           Set the text and data sections to be readable and writable.  Also, do not page-align the data segment, and disable linking against shared libraries.  If the
           output format supports Unix style magic numbers, mark the output as "OMAGIC". Note: Although a writable text section is allowed for PE-COFF targets, it does not
           conform to the format specification published by Microsoft.
		-e entry
       --entry=entry
           Use entry as the explicit symbol for beginning execution of your program, rather than the default entry point.  If there is no symbol named entry, the linker will try to
           parse entry as a number, and use that as the entry address (the number will be interpreted in base 10; you may use a leading 0x for base 16, or a leading 0 for base 8).
		-Tbss=org
       -Tdata=org
       -Ttext=org
           Same as --section-start, with ".bss", ".data" or ".text" as the sectionname.


objcopy
		-O bfdname
       --output-target=bfdname
           Write the output file using the object format bfdname.
		-S
       --strip-all
           Do not copy relocation and symbol information from the source file.  Also deletes debug sections.


gcc
		-fno-builtin
       -fno-builtin-function
           Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with
           __builtin_ as prefix.

           GCC normally generates special code to handle certain built-in
           functions more efficiently; for instance, calls to "alloca" may
           become single instructions which adjust the stack directly, and
           calls to "memcpy" may become inline copy loops.
		
		-ggdb
           Produce debugging information for use by GDB.  This means to use
           the most expressive format available (DWARF, stabs, or the native
           format if neither of those are supported), including GDB extensions
           if at all possible.

		-m32-bit
       -m16-bit
       -m8-bit
           Similar to the stack- data- and const-align options above, these
           options arrange for stack frame, writable data and constants to all
           be 32-bit, 16-bit or 8-bit aligned.  The default is 32-bit
           alignment.

		-gstabs
           Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is
           supported), without GDB extensions.  This is the format used by DBX
           on most BSD systems.  On MIPS, Alpha and System V Release 4 systems
           this option produces stabs debugging output that is not understood
           by DBX.  On System V Release 4 systems this option requires the GNU
           assembler.

        -nostdinc
           Do not search the standard system directories for header files.
           Only the directories explicitly specified with -I, -iquote,
           -isystem, and/or -idirafter options (and the directory of the
           current file, if appropriate) are searched.

        -fstdarg-opt
           Optimize the prologue of variadic argument functions with respect
           to usage of those arguments.

           NOTE: In Ubuntu 14.10 and later versions, -fstack-protector-strong
           is enabled by default for C, C++, ObjC, ObjC++, if none of
           -fno-stack-protector, -nostdlib, nor -ffreestanding are found.

        -Os Optimize for size.  -Os enables all -O2 optimizations except those
           that often increase code size:

           -falign-functions  -falign-jumps -falign-labels  -falign-loops
           -fprefetch-loop-arrays  -freorder-blocks-algorithm=stc

           It also enables -finline-functions, causes the compiler to tune for
           code size rather than execution speed, and performs further
           optimizations designed to reduce code size.
